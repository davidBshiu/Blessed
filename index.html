					<p>The purpose of this app is so that you can easily document events, memories, and stories that show you the things you are thankful for. These personal posts can be easily revisited to remind you of all the blessings you have. From pictues, videos, short stories, to even quotes or Bible verses: these little blessings can encourage you in hard times.</p>
				<h3 id="reason">Reason</h3>
					<p>The reason we made this app is so that people can remember things they are thankful for in life. They can be encouraged and empowered to continue on even if life gets hard. We also want people to have self-reflection on what they care about most in life. This is also to be reflective on seeing what God does for us from day to day in every moment. The verse our app is based off of is this:</p>
					<p><i>2 Corinthians 9:8 (NIV) - And God is able to bless you abundantly, so that in all things at all times, having all that you need, you will abound in every good work.</i></p>
